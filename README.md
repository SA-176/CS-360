Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The application I was meant to develop was a event organizing application that allowed users to add, modify, and delete events from a grid screen. It involved making a log in screen with a SQL database to store users and their passwords with options for new users to sign up and existing users to log in. Then the main screen page required a grid screen and needed users to be able to create apps with names, dates, and descriptions of the events. These events were also to be stored in a database with read and write control. Then finally the last part was to make the application able to push notifications to the user when event dates have come up. 
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The log in screen was a feature that was necessary for user privacy and to ensure they were the only ones altering their events. I based it off of typical user log in screens for other apps so users wouldn't be confused about how it worked. The main screen included a header text that declared it the event screen and had the buttons all listed under the three entry boxes for event name, date and description. The buttons being higher up meant a user didnt have to search for them. Then bellow those but still in the same grid I used scroll elements so the data stored could be scrolled through to see what was listed. 
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  The main technique I used was pre-planning with the goal of finding out which parts of the application would be requiring similar coding methods so I could create simple templates and make sure I could predict exactly how many files I would need in the project to get it to function. This method is always good for project development since it can help cut down on time and the templates created can be used for future projects as well.
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  Lots of testing over and over and over again after any change I was uncertain of. This is extremely important because the more you test the more likely you will find problems before they become too embeded in the project to fix easily or even identify easily. 
  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  The biggest part I had to focus on was the pre-planning and organizing. I made sure I had a good estimation on how many files I would need and of what type. Also creating a simple template of SQL databases to use throughout the coding of the application. 
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I think I did particularly well in the SQL log in system and the page design. I put a lot of time into making sure the color palette was non-abrasive and that the layout was simple to understand. I also tested the log in system in everyway I could think of and made sure that new users couldn't have existing usernames.
